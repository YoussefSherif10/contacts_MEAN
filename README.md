# Contacts

Any user can add a new contact, including their name, phone number, address, and notes. In the grid, edit contacts Delete a contact after getting permission,

If a user locks a contact, other users should immediately see that the contact is locked.

Login page accept two users only -hard coded- (user: user1, pass: user1) (user: user2, pass: user2 ).

I secured the components by using localStorage and JWT for authentication. I used bootstrap for styling and css grid system.

I made http calls to the back end using a service's http module and the ngForms module to add and edit new contacts.

I utilised the MVC architecture in the backend to clearly separate the various responsibilities and make the code easier to read and maintain. I also listed contacts each five in a page using server-side pagination
